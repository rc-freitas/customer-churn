# Telco Customer Churn

One of the biggest challenges in the telecom service industry is to retain customers. Our main aim here is to create a model to forecast if, based on custumer's profile, he or she will churn or not in the future.

In the attempt to classify the customer in churn and no churn categories we will see that with the present data the models developed here are fairly good. The main problem here, as in many other real cases, is the lack o balance between the classes, which in this case means that there are almost 3 times more samples in the No Churn class.

Even thought, some simple models, that run faster then others, like logistic regression and decision trees could restore the balance and could maybe be improved with more data. On the other hand, some models were better in one of the classes. One could use each of them depending on the objectives.

In general, all the models could be improved with a bigger, balanced data set. More features could also be helpful.
